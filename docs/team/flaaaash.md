## Project: MindExpander
MindExpander is a desktop application designed for Primary School students to practice Mathematics, Science and English
questions via a simple Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Overview
I conceptualised the project and guided the team in formulating its structure and objectives. I established the initial
design of our project components and defined how they interact with each other. Additionally, I coordinated team efforts to
ensure alignment with our objectives and adherence to code quality principles.

For the program itself, I was responsible for all aspects of data management, including the Question and QuestionBank
classes. I handled everything related to the Add and Edit features, including their implementation, testing,
and documentation. I also designed and implemented the Undo/Redo behaviour for relevant command class.
